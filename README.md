# Incident-Response-Toolkit
---

### **Description:**  
A collection of custom scripts, tools, and resources designed to streamline **incident response (IR), digital forensics, and threat hunting**. This toolkit provides automation for forensic analysis, memory investigation, log analysis, and system triage, helping security teams quickly detect, analyze, and mitigate cyber threats.

### **Features:**
- **Memory Forensics**: Automated Volatility scripts for memory dump analysis.
- **Log Analysis**: Tools for parsing and analyzing security logs.
- **Triage & Investigation**: Quick system artifact collection and timeline reconstruction.
- **Threat Hunting**: Scripts to detect suspicious processes, connections, and anomalies.
- **Automation**: Bash and Python scripts to speed up DFIR tasks.

### **Use Cases:**
✅ Rapid triage during security incidents  
✅ Automating forensic investigations  
✅ Analyzing malware-infected systems  
✅ Enhancing SOC and blue team workflows  

🔹 **For cybersecurity professionals, SOC analysts, and DFIR practitioners.**

## **Folder Structure & Breakdown**

### 🏗 **01-Preparation/** → Proactive Setup & Baselining
📌 **Goal:** Ensure systems are hardened and security tools are in place before an incident occurs.
📌 **Tools Used:** Security baselines, hardening guides, IR playbooks, cyber range exercises.
📌 **How Analysts Use It:**  
- Define and document security policies.
- Prepare and maintain incident response playbooks.
- Conduct tabletop exercises to test response readiness.

---

### 🔍 **02-Detection/** → Identifying the Initial Threat
📌 **Goal:** Automatically detect threats as early as possible using real-time monitoring and rules.
📌 **Tools Used:** SIEM queries, behavioral detections, signature-based alerts, EDR, IDS/IPS.
📌 **How Analysts Use It:**  
- An alert fires on a suspicious PowerShell execution.
- A YARA rule flags a known malware hash in memory.
- The SIEM detects lateral movement from an endpoint.
🔹 **Key Point:**  
- `02-Detection/` is mostly automated and proactive—it detects signs of compromise but does not perform deep forensic analysis.

---

### 📌 **03-Scoping/** → Investigating the Full Impact
📌 **Goal:** Determine how deep the compromise goes and map attacker activity.
📌 **Tools Used:** Volatility, memory analysis, forensic imaging, log correlation, historical SIEM queries.
📌 **How Analysts Use It:**  
- After detection, an analyst dumps memory and runs Volatility to:
  - List running processes (`pslist`, `psscan`) to find hidden malware.
  - Analyze open network connections (`netscan`) to identify C2 activity.
  - Extract dumped credentials (`lsadump`, `hashdump`) to check for credential theft.
🔹 **Key Point:**  
- `03-Scoping/` is where memory forensics and deeper investigative techniques are used to analyze the full extent of an attack.

---

### 🛑 **04-Containment/** → Isolating the Threat, Preventing Further Harm
📌 **Goal:** Stop attacker activity while preserving forensic evidence.
📌 **Tools Used:** Network isolation, account revocation, firewall updates, forensic imaging.
📌 **How Analysts Use It:**  
- Disable compromised accounts.
- Quarantine infected hosts.
- Block malicious domains or IPs at the firewall.
🔹 **Key Point:**  
- Containment prevents further spread but does not remove attacker artifacts.

---

### 🔥 **05-Eradication/** → Removing Attacker Foothold & Artifacts
📌 **Goal:** Fully remove malware, persistence mechanisms, and backdoors.
📌 **Tools Used:** YARA, AV/EDR cleanup scripts, registry cleaners, forensic validation tools.
📌 **How Analysts Use It:**  
- Delete attacker persistence (registry keys, scheduled tasks, WMI persistence).
- Remove malware from compromised systems.
- Validate cleanup success with forensic scans.
🔹 **Key Point:**  
- `05-Eradication/` ensures the attacker is no longer in the environment before recovery begins.

---

### ♻️ **06-Recovery/** → Restoring Systems & Resuming Business Operations
📌 **Goal:** Restore affected systems securely without reintroducing vulnerabilities.
📌 **Tools Used:** System reimaging, backup recovery, OS integrity checks, vulnerability scans.
📌 **How Analysts Use It:**  
- Validate backups before restoring systems.
- Harden reimaged machines to prevent reinfection.
- Conduct post-recovery scans to ensure no hidden malware remains.
🔹 **Key Point:**  
- Recovery must be carefully executed to avoid reinfection or data loss.

---

### 🔧 **07-Remediation/** → Addressing Root Causes, Closing Security Gaps
📌 **Goal:** Implement long-term fixes to prevent recurrence.
📌 **Tools Used:** Patch management, security hardening, compliance frameworks.
📌 **How Analysts Use It:**  
- Apply security patches and update misconfigured settings.
- Enforce stronger IAM policies and access controls.
- Automate security configurations with SOAR & Ansible.
🔹 **Key Point:**  
- `07-Remediation/` strengthens security posture post-incident.

---

### 📝 **08-Post-Incident Actions/** → Lessons Learned, Compliance & Improvements
📌 **Goal:** Document findings, improve response plans, and meet regulatory obligations.
📌 **Tools Used:** Post-mortem reports, compliance documentation, security awareness training.
📌 **How Analysts Use It:**  
- Conduct root cause analysis and attacker TTP mapping.
- Update incident response plans based on lessons learned.
- File compliance reports for regulatory bodies (NIST, GDPR, ISO).
🔹 **Key Point:**  
- `08-Post-Incident-Actions/` ensures the organization learns from each incident and improves security measures.

---

### 🌎 **Threat-Intelligence/** → Monitoring Adversaries & Emerging Threats
📌 **Goal:** Stay ahead of attackers by leveraging real-time threat intelligence feeds.
📌 **Tools Used:** STIX/TAXII, MISP, open-source threat reports.
📌 **How Analysts Use It:**  
- Monitor TTPs and IOCs related to recent attacks.
- Integrate threat intelligence with SIEM and EDR solutions.
- Automate ingestion of real-time adversary data.
🔹 **Key Point:**  
- Threat intelligence enhances **both detection and investigation** by providing context on known attackers.

---

### 📚 **Documentation/** → Best Practices, Guides, and SOPs
📌 **Goal:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for incident response workflows.
📌 **How Analysts Use It:**  
- Reference playbooks for different types of incidents.
- Share best practices for forensic analysis and remediation.
- Maintain a knowledge base for new IR team members.

🚀 **This toolkit provides structured workflows for handling incidents effectively—whether detecting threats, investigating an attack, containing threats, or remediating security gaps.**
